# BT3103 - Modsmatch@NUS
Modsmatch@nus is a non-profit web application which aims to assist students in finding potential tutors that can guide them in their studies. Students who are struggling and require more attention on certain modules can seek 1-to-1 help from competent tutors who are knowledgeable in the module. On the other hand, students that excel in certain modules but do not wish to teach an entire class will be able to do so on a 1-to-1 basis and possibly earn in the process. In this way, studentsâ€™ learning needs can be easily catered for by the tutor as the teaching is on a smaller scale.
